## Overview

About The Project <br>
This group project is a collection of three retro-inspired arcade games, reimagined with modern features and collaborative design. Each game offering a unique experience. The main goal was to explore game development in a team environment while focusing on functionality, design, and player engagement.

Live Project Link

Key Objectives:

1. Work collaboratively across design, development, and testing roles.

2. Learn and implement core game development principles.

3. Create engaging and visually appealing games using a shared theme.

4. Practice real-world project planning, version control, and documentation.

---

## Planning

We initially decided on an arcade-style theme to keep the project cohesive while allowing creative flexibility. The concept was to create three unique mini-games, each inspired by classic arcade titles but modernized with our own twists.

This structure allowed us to explore different game mechanics and design challenges within one unified project.

ü§ù Team Strategy

To make the most of our individual strengths, we divided the work according to skill sets:

Each team member took ownership of one game, handling most of the development and design.

Shared responsibilities (such as UI styling, testing, or asset creation) were coordinated through regular meetings and collaborative tools.

We used GitHub Projects to track tasks, bugs, and progress throughout development.

This setup promoted independence while encouraging teamwork, review, and cross-support when needed.

## Games

### Game 1: Pac-Man in Space!

Developed & Designed by: Blaise<br>
[View Github](https://github.com/blaisesa)

<strong>Description</strong>

<strong>Pac-Man in Space!</strong> is a retro-inspired twist on the classic Pac-Man game, redesigned to fit a space arcade theme. <br>
Instead of the traditional ghosts, players must now evade Space Invader-style aliens across pixelated mazes set against galactic backgrounds. The game introduces new mechanics such as portals between levels, which not only increase the difficulty but also refresh the gameplay with new map layouts. To add a playful touch, a familiar sound effect from the Mario series is included as a humorous nod to classic gaming culture. This version keeps the core feel of Pac-Man while injecting it with creative, space-themed updates for a fun and nostalgic experience.

  <summary><strong>How to Play!</strong></summary>

Control Pac-Man using either the <b>Arrow keys</b> or <b>WASD</b> to move up, down, left, and right. Press the <b>spacebar</b> to start the game, and use it again to <b>pause</b> or <b>resume</b> during gameplay.

On <b>Touch Devices</b>, swipe in any direction to move and tap once to start. A visible pause button allows you to stop the game at any time. While paused, you can choose to restart, resume, or toggle sound and music settings.

The objective is to collect all food pellets in the maze to clear the level. <b>Nuclear waste</b> grants bonus points, and <b>power-ups</b> temporarily scare the alien enemies, allowing you to eat them for extra score. Once all pellets are collected, find and collide with the <b>portal</b> to progress to the next level.

  <summary><strong>In-Game Features</strong></summary>
  Aliens flee when power-up is collected
When Pac-Man eats a power-up, nearby alien enemies enter a frightened state and run away, allowing Pac-Man to temporarily chase and eat them.

    if (powerUpActive) {
            // Aliens move away from Pacman
            const dx = alien.x - pacman.x;
            const dy = alien.y - pacman.y;
            // Determine direction to move away
            if (Math.abs(dx) > Math.abs(dy)) {
                alien.updateDirection(dx > 0 ? "R" : "L");
            } else {
                alien.updateDirection(dy > 0 ? "D" : "U");
            }
          }

<br><br>
Portal appears upon level completion
Once all food pellets are collected, a portal becomes visible on the map. Colliding with this portal transports the player to the next level.

    function spawnPortal() {
      const portalTiles = 3; // 3x3 portal
      const map = levels[currentLevel];

      let portalRow = 0;
      let portalCol = 0;

    // Find the "p" tile in the current map
      for (let r = 0; r < rowCount; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < colCount; c++) {
            if (map[r][c] === "p") {
                portalRow = r;
                portalCol = c;
                break;
            }
        }
      }
    }

<br><br>
Pac-Man teleports through tunnels
Moving through designated tunnels on the map teleports Pac-Man from one side of the maze to the other, maintaining continuous gameplay flow.

    if (pacman.x <= 0) {
        pacman.x = boardWidth - pacman.width;
    } else if (pacman.x >= boardWidth - pacman.width) {
        pacman.x = 0;
    }
    if (pacman.y <= 0) {
        pacman.y = boardHeight - pacman.height;
    } else if (pacman.y + pacman.height >= boardHeight) {
        pacman.y = 0;
    }

<br><br>
Pac-Man cannot pass through vents, they act as solid obstacles that block Pac-Man‚Äôs movement, requiring the player to navigate around them.

    for (let vent of vents) {
        if (collision(pacman, vent)) {
            // Horizontal collision
            if (
                pacman.velocityX > 0 &&
                pacman.x + pacman.width > vent.x &&
                pacman.x < vent.x + vent.width
            ) {
                pacman.x = vent.x - pacman.width;
            } else if (
                pacman.velocityX < 0 &&
                pacman.x < vent.x + vent.width &&
                pacman.x + pacman.width > vent.x + vent.width
            ) {
                pacman.x = vent.x + vent.width;
            }

            // Vertical collision
            if (
                pacman.velocityY > 0 &&
                pacman.y + pacman.height > vent.y &&
                pacman.y < vent.y
            ) {
                pacman.y = vent.y - pacman.height;
            } else if (
                pacman.velocityY < 0 &&
                pacman.y < vent.y + vent.height &&
                pacman.y + pacman.height > vent.y + vent.height
            ) {
                pacman.y = vent.y + vent.height;
            }

            break; // Exit loop after handling collision
        }
    }

### Game 3: Mini Crash

Developed & Designed by: Hans<br>
[Github link here!](https://github.com/daswinkelmann)<br>

<b>Description</b><br>
Mini-Crash is a fast-paced multiplier game inspired by real-world ‚Äúcrash‚Äù titles seen in crypto and casino gaming.  
Players place a bet, watch the multiplier rise from 1.00x upward and must decide when to cash out before the crash happens!  
The aim is simple: hold your nerve to earn bigger rewards, but don‚Äôt wait too long‚Ä¶ every second counts.

### Progress Tracker

After initial planning, we set up a GitHub Project board to manage tasks, track progress, and facilitate collaboration. Each team member created issues for their assigned tasks, which were then organized with their labels.

## Deployment & Setup

---

## Testing

Testing was conducted throughout the development process to ensure the game functions as intended. Key testing methods included:

- **Unit Testing:** Individual functions and components were tested in isolation to verify their behavior.
- **Integration Testing:** The interaction between different components (e.g., player movement, collision detection) was tested to ensure they work together seamlessly.
- **User Testing:** Playtesting sessions were held with team members and external users to gather feedback on gameplay, controls, and overall experience.

Bugs and issues identified during testing were logged in GitHub Issues and addressed in subsequent development sprints.
